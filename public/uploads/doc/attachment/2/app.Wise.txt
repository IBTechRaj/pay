
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to submit an application for the position of Web Engineer at Wise.

I have long been drawn to computers and development, even before I began formal computer studies. While I was working as a Bank Officer, I was posted to the Computers Department where, using the power of Shell scripts, I drastically reduced the number of man-hours necessary to complete banking tasks. This was a huge accomplishment. Thereafter, I created a banking system application called “Revised Credit Information System” and programmed several applications for the bank and eventually found myself managing the Unix servers and the Oracle database servers. Thereafter when the bank went online, I visited local branches to install both the hardware and the software, and then trained more than 700 employees to use Core Banking Solutions properly! 

Eventually, I left the world of banking to focus on my skills as a programmer. I have been working for a few years as a freelancer, developing websites and projects in C and Unix. I have also recently completed my studies at Microverse, a full-time remote software development program, where I worked with other students from across the globe to master HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and React/Redux. I built more than 50 projects inspired by real-life, including web applications like a Facebook clone, WeatherApp, TodoApp, and Recipe Store. 

While at Microverse, I did pair-programming and I was also a student mentor. I really enjoyed the role of helping them when they were stuck in the course, needed guidance, or needed encouragement. 

I am excited to bring all of my years of experience in banking, systems management, programming, training, and mentoring to Wise. Thank you for taking the time to read my note, and I’m incredibly excited to have the opportunity to be considered for this position. 

Best,
Raj
